### /// The Mission

**Latent Hacks** is not a traditional hackathon. It is the world's first **Aesthetic RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** experiment designed for the next generation of creators (ages 12-18).

We believe that in the age of infinite generative capability, **Aesthetic Quotient (AQ)** becomes the ultimate differentiator.

### /// Infrastructure

We operate on a **Dual-Architecture** strategy:

| **The Engine (Platform)** | **The Brain (Institute)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **URL:** [latenthacks.com](https://www.latenthacks.com/) | **URL:** [aq16.org](https://aq16.org) |
| **Focus:** Exhibition, Registration, Events | **Focus:** Theory, History, Lineage |
| **Stack:** Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind | **Stack:** React, Academic Archives |
| **Status:** `Production` | **Status:** `Research Preview` |

### /// Team & Governance

* **Builder**: Ryan ([@Ryan-Guo123](https://github.com/Ryan-Guo123)) - *Founder & Architect*
* **Supervisor**: Prof. Guo ([@EastChange](https://github.com/EastChange)) - *Academic Advisor (PhD, Aesthetics)*

### /// Transparency

Latent Hacks is a non-profit initiative fiscally sponsored by **The Hack Club (501c3)**.
We practice **Radical Transparency** — all finances are public.
